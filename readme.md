Questions

1. Does the new "Personal Statement" field need to be WYSIWYG? The old one was, so might have formatting.
2. Currently, if there is no street address a location will be set to 'online' even if the 'accepting teleconferencing' checkbox is not checked. Is that correct?
3. Years in practice is a static number field on current site. Should we be calculating start year by the post publish date - start year?
